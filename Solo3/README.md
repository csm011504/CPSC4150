I used the PokeAPI because I am familiar with it.
This is the endpoint I used: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151
It fetches all 151 Generation 1 Pokemon.

You run it like usual, flutter run. To use the app you just click and drag down,
it contains all Gen Ones.

The user actions are the refresh button, as well as the dragging.

An edge case I accounted for was the return of no Pokemon from the fetch.
If this happens, the program will tell the user that no Pokemon were found.
